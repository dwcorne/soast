# SOAST - Suburban-fringe ‘on-demand’ algorithm based shared transport

The SOAST project (PI: Rod McDonald,  co-Is  David Corne, Phil Greening, researchers Jenny Milne, Andrew Spence) was a small project funded by UKCRIC from October 2021 to March 2022.  The goal of the project was to mode the integration of bus and parcel transport, particularly in a UK rural and per-urban context, and deliver a white paper which set out the potentual for such integrations.

To inform the project, and future investigation in this area, we produced the 'SOAST modelling suite', with the aim of deriving a realistic picture of the cost and emissions implications of sharing bus and passenger transport, for a reasonable range of potential systems.
